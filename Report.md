## How I write this program
First of everything, my AP mentor forced me to code this project and I never do that by my own desire. <br />
At the beginning, I read the readme file in our AP GitHub account that explain the project. after that I realized I have to learn about API, Json, how to write readme file and some details about classes in Java. so I start watching videos in YouTube. first, I go for learn more about classes. then I watched some API video from Jadi. after that I start coding from classes. I completed Movie and Actor class base on a Json String that I get in their web. After tasting the methods, I made a menu for my code. unfortunately, I didn't have much time to learn about javaFx to run the code in a graphical environment. At the end, I go for writing readme that you are now reading it.
